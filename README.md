# surfs_up

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to help provide insight on sustainability for a prospective surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. 
The SurfsUp_Challenge file provides insight on weather in the local area for the months of June and December in order to determine if Oahu is the best location for the new business.



## Resources
Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite

Challenge File: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb

Tools: SQLAlchemy, numpy, pandas

Software: SQLite, Python 3.7, Flask, Jupyter Notebook




## Results
Upon analysis, the following statistics were found related to average weather data in Oahu for the month of June:

Below are the statistics found for the average weather in the month of December in Oahu:

As a result of these findings, the following have been determined as three key differences in weather between June and Decemeber:

* The average temperature for the month of June is 4 degrees Farenheit warmer than in the month of December, with June averaging 75 degrees F compared to 71 degrees F in December.

* The minimum temperatures have a greater variation compared to the average temperatures. For the month of June, the minimum temperature on average is 64 degrees Farenheit. Comparatively, for the month of December, the minimum temperature on average is 56 degrees Farenheit. 

* Alternatively, the maximum temperatures were very similar in both June and December in Oahu. In June, the max temperature recorded on average is 85 degrees F and in December, the average max temp is 83 degrees F.

## Summary
After reviewing the data analysis, my personal recommendation would be that it would be a wise decision to open an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu. The temperature is beautiful throughout the year - averaging mid to low 70s - something that is appealing for tourists. There is dependability in what guests can expect; moreover, a difference of 4 degrees is not typically significant enough at that range to be palpable to visitors.
Additionally, the maximum temperature range provides me with even more confidence in this assessment- with a difference of 2 degrees and averaging mid 80s - its safe to say that guests would feel comfortable being on the beach and not uncomfortable in the heat. 
While the minimum temperatures have greater variability, that is fairly common for any location based on season. And, moreover, the variation is not great enough where there would be concerns of guests not being interested in offerings. 
Future queries that could prove insightful include:
1. Assessing average water conditions in the area at that time of year, including water temps, wave height, shark attacks, etc. This data could help investors decide what type of wetsuits would be best to invest their money in - perhaps they could save money and invest in all shortsleeve/shorts versions vs long sleeves/pants styles. 
2. Assessing average beach conditions that time of year- including average wind speeds, UV index, etc. Because the nature of this business is water based, these details could help provide even more micro data to assess if this is the best location.
